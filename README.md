The project uses Flutter as frontend, with PHP scripts accessing database hosted locally with Wampserver.

1. Ensure database is up and running.
Use file "database.sql" to create complete database with entries

2. Ensure PHP and Flutter are installed.

3. Run batch file "run_codequest.bat" to automatically start backend (in 127.0.0.1:8000) and frontend (in Windows).

Note: To fix any connectivity issues between backend and database, modify file backend\config.php
